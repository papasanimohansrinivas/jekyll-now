### This is a ongoing blog about personal product we are building targeting business owners. 

I and my colleague ShekharPatel  are developing a hardware product for detecting fires if they happen on timber  yard.

## July 2019

So on somewhere around July 2019 , shekhar has discussed with me about fire accident happened at his home while working on a project in the company.

## August 2019

Cut to the August 2019 we are discussing holiday plans for Independence day and I was scrolling thorugh twitter feed . I noticed somthing in  my feed regarding fire 

detection [FireNet on Twitter](https://twitter.com/OlafenwaMoses/status/1163776222993801217?s=20) and I immedeiately showed it to shekhar and we agreed  we would do it when in our free 

time. 


## January 2020 

But project did not materialize due to personal emergency of mine  and we got allocated to different teams in the company. And it was january 

2020 i am adjusting to the new team and once again out of boredom i wanted to test some pretrained fire detection models. In free time i had converstaions with 

shekhar regarding product. He suggested to make a ppt about features we can add. Later we  decided product was not worth the cost the features we are providing etc.

It was bit long time back my memory was vague.

## June 2020

I got switched back to old teamd and reunited with shekhar,sreeram,aditya and all. But CORONA happened  we went to lockdown and i came to my hometown. While i was 

doing evening walking i menitioned it to my dad about the project. He encouraged me try solo.I was testing  again pretrained classification models for fire.But 

with no success but one saturday morining  i tried Firenet from twitter on candle fire it was able to draw a box correctly on it from 8 feet distance.
