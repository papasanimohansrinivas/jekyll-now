### This is a ongoing blog about product we are building. 

I and my colleague ShekharPatel  are developing a hardware product for detecting fires if they happen on timber  yard.

So on somewhere around July 2019 , shekhar has discussed with me about fire accident happened at his home and personal damage.

Cut to the August 2019 we are discussing holiday plans for Independence day and i was scrolling thorugh twitter feed . I noticed somthing in  my feed regarding fire 

detection https://twitter.com/OlafenwaMoses/status/1163776222993801217?s=20 and i immedeiately showed it to shekhar and we thought we would do it when in our free 

time.
