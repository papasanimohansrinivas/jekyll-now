### This is a ongoing blog about personal product we are building targeting business owners. 

I and my colleague ShekharPatel  are developing a hardware product for detecting fires if they happen on timber  yard.

## July 2019

So on somewhere around July 2019 , shekhar has discussed with me about fire accident happened at his home while working on a project in the company.

## August 2019

Cut to the August 2019 we are discussing holiday plans for Independence day and I was scrolling thorugh twitter feed . I noticed somthing in  my feed regarding fire 

detection https://twitter.com/OlafenwaMoses/status/1163776222993801217?s=20 and I immedeiately showed it to shekhar and we agreed  we would do it when in our free 

time. 


## January 2020 

But project did not materialize due to personal emergency of mine  and we got allocated to different teams in the company. And it was january 

2020 i am adjusting to the new team and once again out of boredom i wanted to test some pretrained fire detection models.
