Stock Market Trading with help of Python Coding
------------------

# Initial Ask

I had a friend who i routinely chat about stock market trading.

One day he called me and asked a request that he has a little formula in his mind to try out in trading.

And for that to work necessity is that google sheets needs to be updated in one minute interval from yahoo finance.

I by my nature thought by  python coding , it could be done.And started writing code.

He came around later saying that no necessity for coding because he find found about GOOGLEFINANCE function in sheets and

that would be fine.

I stopped working on the task. Then after sometime he called me GOOGLEFINANCE function has failed to load the sheets properly.

So i realised and maybe probably he too realised that coding is the only way to do that.
